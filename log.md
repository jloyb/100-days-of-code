# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice, practicing javaScript, html, and CSS on free code camp.
In HTML and CSS, I learned some basic elements and properties, including how to take input in different ways. Additionally, I learned about classes and ids. 

**Thoughts:** javaScript seems simple thus far. A lot less strict on datatypes then C++. HTML is even simpler, though syntactically it's really different. And primarily only seems useful for visual design and layouts, with little logic that can be implemented natively. I'm interested to see how to incorporate javaScript or jQuery w/ HTML to make things more interesting.


### Day 1: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued, and finished Freecodecamp's course on HTML5 and CSS, and progressed through learning Bootstrap.

**Thoughts** The myriad ways you can inherit and override element properties in CSS seems powerful. Bootstrap has a simple, elegant, concept and I look forward to getting comfortable with its specifics, as so far it feels like I've only scratched the very surface of its capabilities.

### Day 2: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Shifting gears, I returned to the javaScript courses, finishing the basics of it and specifically its approach to Object Oriented Programming.

**Thoughts** Wrapping my head around how JS works with objects took a bit of work, so different it was from my understanding of OOP from C++ and Java. Like, it has practically the same functionalities, but the way it was introduced and how its structured threw me off. I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned of JS to solve algorithm challenges.

### Day 3: May 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got to work on solving some basic algorithmical challenges in javaScript.

**Thoughts** It was nice to find some challenge in this coding fiinally. The open-ended process of solving these challenges is a nice exercise compared to the rudiementary tutorials leading up to them. The challenges themselves weren't particularly complex, mostly consisting of text processing. But, they were really only as easily doable because of the functions provided for string and array processing by javaScript, and I did have to use documentation on js to tackle these challenges effectively.

### Day 4: May 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got to work on solving some more basic algorithmical challenges in javaScript.

**Thoughts** This batch of challenges were slightly more challenging to me than the previous. Was unfamiliar with the logic behind some of the functions that freecodecamp recommended I look at to solve them, so it was nice to familiarize myself with some of those. Still getting these done at a fairly brisk pace, though, so the 50 hours estimate time to solve these all seems a bit... well, perhaps its too early for me to comment on. I still have about a third of them to go.

### Day 5: May 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I completed work on solving basic algorithmical challenges in javaScript.

**Thoughts** These were a fun couple of problems to sort out. Again, array and string processing, but it was quite some bit more interesting than previous ones. Got to learn and try out some neat techniques, like dealing with a dynamic number of passed arguments and unicode values for characters.

### Day 6: May 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I introduced myself to the basics of jQuery, JSON, and APIs.

**Thoughts** The tasks on freecodecamp were very simple to execute, simple copy-pasting. But I took the time to really read and try and dissect and understand the example code.
