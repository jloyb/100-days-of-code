# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice, practicing javaScript, html, and CSS on free code camp.
In HTML and CSS, I learned some basic elements and properties, including how to take input in different ways. Additionally, I learned about classes and ids. 

**Thoughts:** javaScript seems simple thus far. A lot less strict on datatypes then C++. HTML is even simpler, though syntactically it's really different. And primarily only seems useful for visual design and layouts, with little logic that can be implemented natively. I'm interested to see how to incorporate javaScript or jQuery w/ HTML to make things more interesting.


### Day 1: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued, and finished Freecodecamp's course on HTML5 and CSS, and progressed through learning Bootstrap.

**Thoughts** The myriad ways you can inherit and override element properties in CSS seems powerful. Bootstrap has a simple, elegant, concept and I look forward to getting comfortable with its specifics, as so far it feels like I've only scratched the very surface of its capabilities.
